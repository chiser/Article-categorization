# Article-categorization

We have a list of products that are assigned to categories. We first did a bag of words in order to form a machine readable vector for each of the words in the vocabulary. Once we have this bag of words we proceed with a naive bayes approach to learn to classify for making predictions.
We additionally tried the word2vec algorithm that should include context to the words (It is not the same "riegel milka" than "milka riegel")
Further commits should implement SVM, random forests and CNN for benchmarking
